    // Promise) using subscribe.

// .subscribe can also handle failures and stream completion by passing a function to the
// second and third arguments respectively. In a production app it would be a good idea to
// handle those cases, too. That is, this.loading should also be set to false if the request
// fails (i.e. the stream emits an error).
